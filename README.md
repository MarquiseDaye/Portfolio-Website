# Portfolio-Website
Hello and welcome to my first portfolio website made from HTML, CSS & JavaScript. My name is Marquise Daye and I created this website to demonstrate my skills in these
programs in pursuit for a full time position as a web developer or a front-end developer. I am looking to create more in the future as I had fun making this website. 
Hope you enjoy!
