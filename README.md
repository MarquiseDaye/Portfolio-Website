# Portfolio-Website
Hello and welcome to my first portfolio website made from HTML, CSS & JavaScript. My name is Marquise Daye and I created this website to demonstrate my skills in these
programs in pursuit for a full time position as a web developer or a front-end developer. There are some things I struggled on or didnt know how to do when creating some aspects of this site. I will either come back to implement them in this site or improve upon them on the next portfolio website I make in the future. I am looking to create more in the future as I had fun making this website. 
Hope you enjoy!
